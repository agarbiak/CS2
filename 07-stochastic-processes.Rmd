# Stochastic processes

## Learning Objectives {-#objectives-stochastic-processes}

1. Define in general terms a stochastic process and in particular a counting process.
2. Classify a stochastic process.
3. Describe possible applications of mixed processes.
4. Explain what is meant by the Markov property in the context of a stochastic process and in terms of filtrations.
