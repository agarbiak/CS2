# Introduction {#id-00-intro}

This book is **unpublished** and should be considered an **early build** version. There will be **bugs**, **typos** and **errors**. Please report them [here](https://github.com/agarbiak/CS2/issues).

## Motivation {#id-00-motivation}

The purpose of this book is to help actuaries studying [Risk Modelling and Survival Analysis (CS2)](https://www.actuaries.org.uk/studying/curriculum/actuarial-statistics) from the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries by providing `R` code examples across the following topic areas:

1. Random variables and distributions for risk modelling
2. Time series
3. Stochastic processes
4. Survival models
5. Machine learning
